This notebook explains what happens under the hood for the GO-UniProt dataset. It covers\n",

    "The chebai package simplifies the handling of these datasets by **automatically creating** them as needed. This means that you do not have to input any data manually; the package will generate and organize the data files based on the parameters and encodings selected. This feature ensures that the right data is available and formatted properly. You can however provide your own data files, for instance if you want to replicate a specific experiment.\n",

    "### Inheritance Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "GO_UniProt data classes inherit from [`_DynamicDataset`](https://github.com/ChEB-AI/python-chebai/blob/dev/chebai/preprocessing/datasets/base.py#L597), which in turn inherits from [`XYBaseDataModule`](https://github.com/ChEB-AI/python-chebai/blob/dev/chebai/preprocessing/datasets/base.py#L22). Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`_DynamicDataset`**: This class serves as an intermediate base class that provides additional functionality or customization for datasets that require dynamic behavior. It inherits from `XYBaseDataModule`, which provides the core methods for data loading and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`XYBaseDataModule`**: This is the base class for data modules, providing foundational properties and methods for handling and processing datasets, including data splitting, loading, and preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, GO_UniProt data classes are designed to manage and preprocess chemical data effectively by leveraging the capabilities provided by `XYBaseDataModule` through the `_DynamicDataset` intermediary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Data classes related to proteins can be configured using the following main parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`go_branch (str)`**: The Gene Ontology (GO) branch. The default value is `\"all\"`, which includes all branches of GO in the dataset.\n",
    "  - **`\"BP\"`**: Biological Process branch.\n",
    "  - **`\"MF\"`**: Molecular Function branch.\n",
    "  - **`\"CC\"`**: Cellular Component branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows for more specific datasets focused on a particular aspect of gene function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`splits_file_path (str, optional)`**: Path to a CSV file containing data splits. If not provided, the class will handle splits internally. The default is `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Input Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "To get more control over various aspects of data loading, processing, and splitting, you can refer to documentation of additional parameters in docstrings of the respective classes: [`_GOUniProtDataExtractor`](https://github.com/ChEB-AI/python-chebai/blob/dev/chebai/preprocessing/datasets/go_uniprot.py#L33), [`XYBaseDataModule`](https://github.com/ChEB-AI/python-chebai/blob/dev/chebai/preprocessing/datasets/base.py#L22), [`_DynamicDataset`](https://github.com/ChEB-AI/python-chebai/blob/dev/chebai/preprocessing/datasets/base.py#L597), etc.\n",

    "__Note__: Check the code implementation of classes [here](https://github.com/ChEB-AI/python-chebai/blob/dev/chebai/preprocessing/datasets/go_uniprot.py):\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a range of available dataset classes for GOUniProt classes. Usually, you want to use `GOUniProtOver250` or `GOUniProtOver50`. Both inherit from `_GOUniProtOverX`. The number indicates the threshold for selecting label classes. The selection process is based on the annotations of the GO terms with its ancestors across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer `select_classes` method of `_GOUniProtOverX` for more details on selection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a different threshold, you can create your own subclass."

    "These methods are executed automatically within the data class instance. Users do not need to call them explicitly, as the code internally manages the preparation and setup of data, ensuring that it is ready for subsequent use in training and validation processes.\n",

    "1. **`prepare_data` Method**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: This method checks for the presence of raw data in the specified directory. If the raw data is missing, it fetches the ontology, creates a dataframe, and saves it to a file (`data.pkl`). The dataframe includes columns such as IDs, data representations, and labels.\n",
    "   - **Documentation**: [PyTorch Lightning - `prepare_data`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/data/datamodule.html#prepare-data)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`setup` Method**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: This method sets up the data module for training, validation, and testing. It checks for the processed data and, if necessary, performs additional setup to ensure the data is ready for model input. It also handles cross-validation settings if enabled.\n",
    "   - **Description**: Transforms `data.pkl` into a model input data format (`data.pt`), ensuring that the data is in a format compatible for input to the model. The transformed data contains the following keys: `ident`, `features`, `labels`, and `group`. This method uses a subclass of Data Reader to perform the transformation.\n",
    "   - **Documentation**: [PyTorch Lightning - `setup`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/data/datamodule.html#setup)\n",

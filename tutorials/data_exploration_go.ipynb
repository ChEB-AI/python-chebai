    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a guide for new users of the `chebai` package, which is used for working with chemical data, especially focusing on Gene Ontology (GO) and Swiss UniProt Protein data. This notebook will explain how to instantiate the main data class, how the data files are structured, and how to work with different molecule encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key aspect of the package is its **dataset management system**. In the training process, chemical datasets play a critical role by providing the necessary data for model learning and validation. The chebai package simplifies the handling of these datasets by **automatically creating** them as needed. This means that users do not have to manually prepare datasets before running models; the package will generate and organize the data files based on the parameters and encodings selected. This feature ensures that the right data is available and formatted properly.\n",

    "# 1. Instantiation of a Data Class\n",
    "\n",
    "To start working with `chebai`, you first need to instantiate a GO_UniProt data class. This class is responsible for managing, interacting with, and preprocessing the GO and UniProt data\n",
    "### Inheritance Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "GO_UniProt data classes inherit from [`_DynamicDataset`](https://github.com/ChEB-AI/python-chebai/blob/dev/chebai/preprocessing/datasets/base.py#L597), which in turn inherits from [`XYBaseDataModule`](https://github.com/ChEB-AI/python-chebai/blob/dev/chebai/preprocessing/datasets/base.py#L22). Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`_DynamicDataset`**: This class serves as an intermediate base class that provides additional functionality or customization for datasets that require dynamic behavior. It inherits from `XYBaseDataModule`, which provides the core methods for data loading and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`XYBaseDataModule`**: This is the base class for data modules, providing foundational properties and methods for handling and processing datasets, including data splitting, loading, and preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, GO_UniProt data classes are designed to manage and preprocess chemical data effectively by leveraging the capabilities provided by `XYBaseDataModule` through the `_DynamicDataset` intermediary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Data classes related to proteins can be configured using the following main parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`go_branch (str)`**: The Gene Ontology (GO) branch. The default value is `\"all\"`, which includes all branches of GO in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`splits_file_path (str, optional)`**: Path to a CSV file containing data splits. If not provided, the class will handle splits internally. The default is `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Input Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "To get more control over various aspects of data loading, processing, and splitting, you can refer to documentation of additional parameters in docstrings of the respective classes: [`_GOUniProtDataExtractor`](https://github.com/ChEB-AI/python-chebai/blob/dev/chebai/preprocessing/datasets/go_uniprot.py#L33), [`XYBaseDataModule`](https://github.com/ChEB-AI/python-chebai/blob/dev/chebai/preprocessing/datasets/base.py#L22), [`_DynamicDataset`](https://github.com/ChEB-AI/python-chebai/blob/dev/chebai/preprocessing/datasets/base.py#L597), etc.\n",

    "# 2. Preparation / Setup Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a GOUniProt data class instance is created, it typically requires preparation before use. This step is necessary to download or load the relevant data files and set up the internal data structures.\n",
    "### Automatic Execution: \n",
    "These methods are executed automatically within the data class instance. Users do not need to call them explicitly, as the code internally manages the preparation and setup of data, ensuring that it is ready for subsequent use in training and validation processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Preparation Needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Availability**: The preparation step ensures that the required GOUniProt data files are downloaded or loaded, which are essential for analysis.\n",
    "- **Data Integrity**: It ensures that the data files are transformed into a compatible format required for model input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Methods for Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The data preprocessing in a data class involves two main methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`prepare_data` Method**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: This method checks for the presence of raw data in the specified directory. If the raw data is missing, it fetches the ontology, creates a dataframe, and saves it to a file (`data.pkl`). The dataframe includes columns such as IDs, data representations, and labels.\n",
    "   - **Documentation**: [PyTorch Lightning - `prepare_data`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/data/datamodule.html#prepare-data)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`setup` Method**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: This method sets up the data module for training, validation, and testing. It checks for the processed data and, if necessary, performs additional setup to ensure the data is ready for model input. It also handles cross-validation settings if enabled.\n",
    "   - **Description**: Transforms `data.pkl` into a model input data format (`data.pt`), ensuring that the data is in a format compatible for input to the model. The transformed data contains the following keys: `ident`, `features`, `labels`, and `group`. This method uses a subclass of Data Reader to perform the transformation.\n",
    "   - **Documentation**: [PyTorch Lightning - `setup`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/data/datamodule.html#setup)\n",
    "\n",
